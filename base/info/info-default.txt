^2^1O^2bstacle ^1C^2ourse Information^7--

Your objective is to get to the armoury.  Buy ammo to win.

Medis are bonus.  You can't use the jetpack, luci, flamer or
grenade to use them.  You will lose your medi status on death.

Boosters are checkpoints.  Shoot them to activate.  Your medi
stats will be saved.

Some telenodes will teleport to another.  You will not spawn in
these.  Press your use/evolve key (default 'q') facing it's
hitbox (where you collide into it, usually it's base).  To bind,
'^3\bind x +button7^7'. replace x with your key

Some oc's allow you to evolve into different alien classes.
To evolve into..
Granger:           '^3\class builder^7'
Advanced Granger:  '^3\class builderupg^7'
Dretch:            '^3\class level0^7'
Basilisk:          '^3\class level1^7'
Advanced Basilisk: '^3\class level1upg^7'
Advanced Marauder: '^3\class level2^7'
Marauder:          '^3\class level2upg^7'
Dragoon:           '^3\class level3^7'
Advanced Dragoon:  '^3\class level3upg^7'
Tyrant:            '^3\class level4^7'

To restart the obstacle course (the only way to win again),
'^3\restartoc^7'

Look out for arrows.  They will point in the direction to the
armoury

^2Scrimming in oc's^7--

^2General + admins^7--

Two teams can scrim.  An admin will '^5!putscrimteam client team^7'
and '^5!startocscrim m/a^7 (all Medis / Arm)'

To leave a scrim, console '^3\leaveocscrim^7'.

Note to admins: any new scrim players after '^5!startocscrim^7'
                 - will be out of synch with medi, arm and
                 - checkpoint stats.  An armory win will synch
                 - every new player on the same scrim team's
                 - arm stats, using a medi, and shooting a
                 - checkpoint.  An out of synch player
                 - using a medi arm or booster will erase
                 - every previous medi arm or booster, because
                 - they'll start out with no medis arms or
                 - checkpoints.

To clear an oc, run '^5!clearocscrim^7'

QUOTE:
circle, or anybody else, if you ever wanted to start an oc scrim:
 ]!putscrimteam player teamname
teamname can be anything. if it doesn't exist, it gets created (only up to two teams are valid). first team to be created gets las gun. second gets md.

after all the players are put on the two opposing teams..
 ]!startocscrim m
 OR
 ]!startocscrim a
the latter is first to armory mode.  the other is first team to use all medis mode
when you're all done
 ]!clearocscrim
or if you're too lazy, everybody can   /leavocscrim, but then the guns will still be reserved.

Good luck :)
...END

^2Rules^7--

The team to tag the armoury or grab every medi first wins.
The scrim team acts as a whole.  Each team keeps its own medi
status, arm stats and checkpoint.

Run '^3\stats^7' to see the current oc's stats.  Run '/stats mapname'
to see mapname oc's stats.  Run '^3\stats mapname layoutname^7' to see mapname
layoutname's stats.  For exmaple, '^3\stats arachnid2 oc2^7'.

Run '^3\mystats^7' to see your own stats.

^3Other useful commands^7--

'^3/DisableAutoAngle^7' - On teleportation and other spawning and restarting,
this will keep your viewing angle from resetting to the buildable you end up on.
Note that the angle needs to be reset after death.  Run'^3/EnableAutoAngle^7'
to always reset.  The default auto angle is disabled


'^3/quickrestartoc^7' - restart quickly
'^3/teleboost^7' - Teleport to your last checkpoint

^3ATCS walkthrough for beginners^7--


Beginners read this!

To begin, /callvote map atcs

Jump from the ret to the defence computer at the end of the first slope.
Next, jump around the 3 teslas.  Use the wall to keep you from traveling farther
away from the teslas.  Once you land, shoot the booster.  That's the first
checkpoint.
Jump from the turret to the teslas.  After that, sprint without jumping from the
defence computer closest to the high tesla and lower teslas.  The ceiling is too
low to jump.  If you fall, you need to use a slope jump to get back up.  Jump
jump while running up the slope (or in more beginner terms, get a head start).
jump from tesla to tesla.  After that, jump on the two dc's (defence computers)
by jumping from either right next the dc's where you have no actual speed and
thus will not lose height, or jump from the top ledge where there is no slope.
Jump and SPRINT from the ret (machinegun turret) to jump over the teslas.
There are more difficult ways to do this, but since this is a beginners guide
I won't spoil any extra techniques and will only explain the easiest method.
This may also be true for everything else in this course.
Shoot the booster after the teslas, and crouch between the wall and the
rc (reactor) on the right.  It probably will take a little big of wiggling of
the mouse and strafing left and right (A and D keys) to get in for the
inexperienced.  Jump over the next ret, once again, jumping off a slope
(this technique is commonly refered to as a ramp jump).  Jump down to the next
row of dc's. You're objective here is to get through the teslas onto the other
side.  This is called crouch jumping.  Crouch jumping is jumping in air. Press
space, press c in air.  The key is to let go of space BEFORE you press c,
otherwise you will not crouch.  That is the most common mistake beginners have.
Another few things to remember to always have a little head start, a little
distance / back up from the teslas.  Also remember this needs to be done quick,
all in a matter of milliseconds, and before you land.  Spectators on the outside
will see you crouching in air as well as other players seeing you.  I'll
reiterate, let go of space before you press c, or you will not crouch jump!
After that, jump from the repeater onto the dc, from that dc onto the last,
and jump onto the teslas (may need another crouch jump depending on which tesla
you land on).  shoot the checkpoint.  In atcs middle, on the left side relative
to the direction you came from, you will find bonus medical stations, but a dead
end.  If you decide to get the bonus medis, come back because you need to go
through the right-hand path.  Use the slope next to the left dc to jump on/over.
If you can't seem to do it, sprint with a good head start, and jump right before
you hit the slope, and the slope will carry you.  If you happen to land in the
middle, don't worry, you are NOT stuck!  You need to jump and wiggle your way
out.  The next step needs the same technique, but is quite harder.  Use the
slope to the right of the defence computer.  Walk up the stairs and jump on the
ret from the top of the stairs.  From the ret, jump onto the top of the building
closest to the alien / red entrance/exit.  Jump from there to the other side of
the top of the building past the gap.  If you fall, keep trying and practice;
jump and the ret again and start over.  Finally, drop down to the human exit.
Shoot the booster.  Walk up to the arm and buy ammunition (or use the
armoury another way).  Good luck :)
