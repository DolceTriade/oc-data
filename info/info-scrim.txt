A scrim is a race between a team of one or multiple players either first to use
the arm or medis.

To join a scrim, in console type '/joinScrim lgun team name'.  Replace lgun with
any of the following guns:
 -rifle
 -shotgun
 -chaingun
 -lgun
 -mdriver
 -prifle
 -lcannon
 -flamer
 -psaw
 -grenade

and, of course, replace team name with your desired team name.

If the team name already exists, you will join the team and the weapon is
ignored.

Once the teams are settled, type '/callvote startscrim a' to start an armory
scrim or '/callvote startscrim m' to start a medi scrim vote.

The first team to use every medical station (or armoury) wins.  All medis
count for the team as well as checkpoints.  Death will also influence
losing medis.  After the first team wins each team will be given
${g_ocScrimAfterTime} seconds to finish.

_Once the warmup or scrim has started_, Team chat will be redirected to
everybody on your scrim team and nobody else.  Admins will not be able to
scrim teamchat unless they are on your team (although the teamchat does
get logged along with everything else said in games.log so abuse
can dealt with).  Team chat will only be redirected either during the actual
teamplay or during the scrim warmup.

If you are the only person on your scrim team, your score will be recorded

Type '/callvote endscrim' if you wish to end the scrim.  Unlike a vote for
startscrim, this vote can only called if the player is not on a scrim team and
players can vote for a called endscrim vote if they are not on a scrim team.
