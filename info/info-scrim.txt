A scrim is a race between a team of one or multiple players either first to use
the arm or medis.

To join a scrim, in console type '/joinScrim lgun team name'.  Replace lgun with
any of the following available weapons:
 -rifle
 -shotgun
 -chaingun
 -lgun
 -mdriver
 -prifle
 -lcannon
 -flamer
 -psaw
 -grenade

and, of course, replace team name with your desired team name.

If the team name already exists, you will join the team and the weapon is
ignored.

Once the teams are set up, type '/callvote startscrim a' to start an armory
scrim or '/callvote startscrim m' to start a medi scrim vote.

Once the scrim begins, non-admin players will not be able to join.  If a player
is not playing alone on his team, no stats will be recorded.

The first team to use every medical station (or armoury) wins.  All medis
count for the team as well as checkpoints.  Players need to secure medis
so that they aren't lost.  After the first team wins each team will be given
${g_ocScrimAfterTime} (g_ocScrimAfterTime) seconds to finish.

_Once the warmup or scrim has started the WARMUP, Team chat will be redirected to
everybody on your scrim team and nobody else.  Admins will not be able to
view scrim teamchat unless they are on your team (although the teamchat does
get logged along with everything else said in games.log so that abuse
can dealt with).  Team chat will only be redirected either during the actual
scrim or during the scrim warmup.

Type '/callvote endscrim' if you want to end a scrim early.  Unlike a vote for
startscrim, this vote can only called if the player is on a scrim team and
players can only vote for a called endscrim vote if they are on a scrim team.
