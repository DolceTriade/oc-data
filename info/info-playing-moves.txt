--THREE TYPES OF MOVEMENT--

There are three different types of jump movement in Tremulous:
 1) After jumping, the Z axis is constant
 3) After jumping, the Z axis is never negative
 2) After jumping, the Z axis is not constant

The first type listed is used in most Tremulous 1.1.0 servers.  Height is never gained nor lost

The second type listed is used by some of the most recent development servers,
MercenariesGuild included.  With this movement type, height can be gained, but it is never lost

The third time is the least common movement type.  It is usually used by a small
number of development servers.  Height is not restricted.  This mode adds more
realism to the game and opens many possibities for reaching special places and
areas.  The OC server uses this movement.

Because of the method we believe is best for movement itself, velocity and
slopes will affect the height gained or lost.  The faster you are,
the more your height will be affected.  The steeper the slope is, the more
height is be affected.  If you jump running up a slope, you will gain
height.  If you jump running down a slope, you will lose height.  As a beginner,
try to get a lot of distance before jumping to practice gaining speed on a
slope.

--CROUCHING IN AIR--

Another fundamental move is commonly referred to as "crouch jumping".  Crouch
jumping is performed by pressing the jump key, releasing the jump key, and
pressing and holding down the crouch key.  It is a common beginner's mistake
to hold down the jump key while pressing the crouch key.  You cannot crouch
while you are pressing jump key.  If your jump key is bound to spacebar and your
crouch key is bound to 'c', you will only crouch when 'c' is pressed and
spacebar is not.  Crouch jumping can be difficult to learn at first, but it
becomes second nature after practice.

--BUNNY HOPPING--

Bunny hopping is pretty straightforward and easy to do, but can often
be difficult to time when combining bunny hopping with other advanced movements.
To bunny hop, press space any amount of time before you land, and release
and press again immediately after you jump (assuming you have jump bound to
spacebar).  As long as space is pressed when and for each time you touch a
solid surface, you will jump.  To help you understand this, try standing in one place
and press space twice quickly.  Press and release space the first time
immediately, but hold it down and do not release it the second time.  Regardless
of time at which you press it the second time, you'll jump as long as it's pressed (without crouch
pressed).

--ACCELERATION--

There are several methods that you can use to accelerate.  The most common
methods are: slightly turning the camera, immediately changing direction of
movement by 45o, and pouncing as a Dragoon.  Walking on the ground will
cause your velocity to return to 320.
