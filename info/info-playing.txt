This document explains the basic rules of playing an Obstacle Course.
For other documents about playing, see ^2!info playing-more^7.

There are several Obstacle Courses (abbreviated as OC's) that are available
for play.  To see these OC's see ^2!info list^7.

Most OC's are for humans.  In human oc's, players may only join the human team
(Note that admins occasionally may find mistakes.  If they do, they can use
any weapon and join any team.  See FAQ #1 (^2!info faq^7) for more information).

Your primary objective is to get to the armoury.  There are several OC's
which have multiple armouries, and in that case all need to be used.  Most
OC's have a single armoury only.

Along your way to the armoury, don't forget to use the medical stations
(abbreviated as medis).  Medical stations are typically more numerous and more
difficult to use than armouries.  There are a few OC's which do not include
any armouries.

There are several checkpoints to help you win.  All boosters are checkpoints.
As a human, shoot the checkpoint to activate it.  As an alien, slash, slice
bite or chomp the booster to active it.
