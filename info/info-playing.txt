Most OC's (Obstacle Course) are designed for human play.

Your primary objective is to get to the armoury.  Some OC's have
multiple armouries, most of which all will need to be used in order to
win, unless (press your bound )

Most OC's have many medical stations built for bonus.  These are usually
more difficult to reach than the armoury.  Healing hasn't
been changed in the OC mod (medis will heal and give medkit).

You can save your progress by activating a checkpoint (booster).
Shoot, slice, or bite a checkpoint to activate it.  When you die, you
will lose all unsaved your used medis and armouries.

Some telenodes allow you to teleport.  Aim at the _base_ of one of
these telenodes and press 'use' (default 'q') to teleport.
