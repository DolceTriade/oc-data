OC mods >= 2.0 are compatible with Tremulous 1.2

Misc commands:
 '/teleboost' - teleports to the checkpoint and simulates a death (you will
    - lose all medis and arms up to the last saved checkpoint).
 '/restartOC' - old restart method.  Kills you and restarts the obstacle course
 '/quickRestartOC' - restarts OC without death and autoangle is not
    - forced (see '/enableAutoAngle' below).
 '/enableAutoAngle' - enables auto angle to the default state, enabled.  On
    - teleportation or restarting, if this is enabled, the angles of the player
    - is reset to angles of the telenode or other entity involved.  Note that
    - on death, the angles of the players are lost and autoAngle is forced on
    - spawn.
    - autoAngle is almost never prefered but it is kept for the minority who
    - prefer the old behaviour.
 '/disableAutoAngle' disables auto angle.
 '/CPMode' - there are 3 modes oc cp'ing: enabled, print, and disabled.  Run
    - this command without any arguments to see more.
