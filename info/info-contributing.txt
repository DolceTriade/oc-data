--HOW TO DEVELOP AND SUBMIT AN OBSTACLE COURSE

An OC is simply built and saved.  Building is OC mode is recommended.
To build an OC in editoc mode:
1: load the map
2: Use '!layoutsave layoutname' (layoutname must be an oc layout, see
    - ^2!info layout^7)
3: Use '!restart layoutname'
4: Use '!editoc 1' (or '!editoc 2' to let everybody make changes)

After editoc is enabled, build the obstacle course.

In editoc mode, you can manually power or unpower a buildables.  It is almost always
ideal to leave a buildable unpowered.

In editoc mode, you can also 

--SUBMITTING AN OBSTACLE COURSE

There are several things which need to be considered before uploading

 -Does the course use any obsolete flags?  We don't normally accept any
    - new layouts with obsolete flags
 -Is there another OC of the same general type?  If there is, make sure that
    - it is worth uploading when another OC in the same map can be played as
    - well.  In other words, try to make it either significantly better or
    - significantly different.  Many hours have been wasted from course
    - developers ignored this.  Don't ignore this guideline.
 -Does the layout cover the entire map it is being developed?  Every vent
    - or nook and cranny does not need to filled, but there should be no empty
    - spots.  This is one of the less strict rules.  Try to fill in as much
    - as possible.
 -Is it good?  Try to be unique and original.  Don't be repetitive.

Next, determine the OC's difficulty:

Beginner: a newcomer can beat it with some if not little skill.
Intermediate: a regular player with moderate skill can beat it.
Advanced: takes a little more skill or determination than usual skill to win.
Expert: takes a considerable amount of skill.  Many will be frusturated and give
    - up.
Insane: a course for the master of the master.  Takes an extremely high level of
    - skill to win.
