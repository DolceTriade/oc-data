--LAYOUT NAMES

The filename of a course (typically oc.dat) determines the type of it.
Certain flags are recognized.  For example, since the 'o' flag
enables players to only need to use one armoury to win, a layout with name of 
oco.dat will enable players to do that.  Note that the first two characters ('oc')
are ignored when flags are determined.  You can also append a suffix in which
no characters will be interpreted as a flag by adding a '_'.  Everything after the
first '_' will not be read as a flag.  For example, we could have noted that
the course only has medis in it by layoutsaving it as 'oco_medisonly' (which
would create the file oc_medisonly.dat)

These flags are recognized in OC mod versions >= v2.0 (This
server is using OC mod v${g_version}):
o:  Only one armoury needs to be used in order to win
c:  No creep (humans won't be slowed down)
h:  Humans can join the human team and play as one.  This flag is implied when no alien class flags are set
w:  Wall-walking is disabled.
g:  Grangers can play.  This and all other alien class flags will, when set, enable players to join the alien team.
^g: Advanced grangers can play.  This and all other alien class flags will, when set, enable players to join the alien team.
d:  Dretches can play.
b:  Basilisks.
^b: Advanced basilisks.
m:  Marauders.
^m: Advanced marauders.
r:  Dragoons;
^r: Advanced dragoons;
t:  Tyrants.
l:  When this flag is set, lucifer cannon mode is enabled: players will spawn with a lucifer cannon, and will be able to use bonuses with it.

These flags are used in older versions of the OC mod (< v2.0):
n: Use the old behaviour of armouries: only one armoury has to be used to win
a: Players can buy at any armoury (otherwise they need to win before they can buy equipment)  NOTE: this flag will only work on OC mods >= v2.0
p: Players will never be slowed down by creep
a: only the alien team can play
b: both teams can play
w: aliens cannot wallwalk
g: grangers can play
^^7g: advanced grangers can play
d: dretches can play
l: basilisks can play
^^7l: advanced basilisks can play
m: marauders can play
^^7m: advanced marauders can play
h: dragoons can play
^^7h: advanced dragoons can play
t: tyrants can play
u: luci-jump mode; players spawn with and can use a lucifer cannon
*u: all turrets are unpowered
*e: all teslas are unpowered
*r: all reactors will not zap aliens

*: obsolete flag; do not use
-

All digits (0-9) will never be used as a flag.

Usually, only these suffixes (part after the '_') are used:

If two OC's have the same name, add numbers starting with 2.  For example, if
a layout 'oc' already exists for a map when a second one is built, name it
'oc2'.  The next layout will be named 'oc3' and etc.

If the layout has a '_', the underscore itself and everything after it is
ignored.  Typically, an underscore is used only with one of the following
standard suffixes:

review: Changes need to be reviewed.
beta: Stats will most likely be reset.  New medical stations and armouries
    - can be built.
medisonly: No armouries.
armsonly: There aren't any medical stations.

contrib: The name is misleading, but is kept for historical reasons (and laziness).
    - This suffix means that the OC is poor, crappy, or unfinished.

This suffix was also accepted but was never used before v2.0
indevelopment: The OC isn't finished.
